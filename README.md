svnstash
========

An svn extension that adds stashing to the repository.

Commands
--------

More documentation here later -- for now, run `svnstash help` for more help.

Bash Autocompletion
-------------------

Source the svnstash.bash file to get some autocompletion.  It's pretty rough for now, but will be better later.
